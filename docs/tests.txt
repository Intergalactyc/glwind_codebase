Writing tests:
    Tests should return whether or not they *failed*. False if success, True if failure.

Incorporating tests:
    A test script file should have its title prefixed with "TEST-", and be included directly in the tests directory (glwind_codebase/tests/).
    Within the test script, there should be a function RUN_TESTS.
        Tests should be incorporated into this function. The RUN_TESTS function can then optionally be called in a main body loop for a call of the single file.
        This function should return 0 if all tests pass, and otherwise return an integer error code corresponding to the test which failed.

Running tests:
    Test files can be individually run if they are written to include a call to RUN_TESTS in their main body loop.
    To run all test files in the tests directory, execute run_tests.py in that directory.

Test contexts:
    A test file requires access to import 

For an example, see e.g. TEST-atmo_calc.py in the tests directory.
