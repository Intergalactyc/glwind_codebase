Original workflow here:
combine -> reduce -> (plots, profiles, windroses)

Information (* - library):
combine.py - load data (accounting for the weird formatting), merge into one nicely formatted dataframe
reduce.py - outlier removal, resampling, compute derived quantities, perform stability + terrain classifications
*helper_functions.py - useful functions for calculations
windroses.py - generate various windroses
profiles.py - generate wind profile plots
plots.py - generate other plots
