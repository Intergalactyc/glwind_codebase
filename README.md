This is a repository of the code and data used in the [Summer 2024 GLWind REU](https://engineering.csuohio.edu/glwind_reu/glwind_reu) program. It was designed both for our own use and to allow others in the future to more easily build upon our work. The majority of this repository is dedicated to the code first used for analysis on a dataset from Cedar Rapids, Iowa for the project *Wind profile characterization based on surface terrain and atmospheric thermal stability*.
